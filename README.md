Investigations into MLB Park Effects

I have developed a method for analyzing pitch- and PA-level park effects which eliminates player selection bias by means of a pairwise analyis. The details of this method (for pitch-level) can be found in Pairwise_Analysis.pdf.

Park_Effects.py includes everything you need to replicate my analysis, including preset examples. Feel free to mess around with it, but I didn't put a huge amount of effort into explaining the parameters so you may run into issues.
